## Participant Requirements

We request that all participants **bring their own laptop** to the workshop with the software listed below installed and an up-to-date modern web browser:

### Bash Shell
Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple tasks more quickly.

Platform | Installation Instructions | Link to Installation Help
---------|---------------------------|--------------------------
Windows  | Git Bash? Or stick with other option? | TBD
Mac OS X | Comes pre-installed - look for Terminal (found in /Applications/Utilities) | n/a
Linux    | Comes pre-installed - The default shell is usually Bash, but if your machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a terminal and typing bash. | n/a

### Git & GitHub Account
Git is a version control system, and GitHub is a hosting platform for Git Repositories.

These are not required, but we strongly recommend them for ease of pulling down the workshop data.

Platform | Installation Instructions | Link to Installation Help
---------|---------------------------|--------------------------
Windows  | Download & Run the Git for Windows [installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). After that installation completes, follow only [step 2 forward on the GitHub setup site](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#platform-windows) to finish your Git/GitHub installation & setup. | https://git-for-windows.github.io/, https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#platform-windows
Mac OS X | Install and set up Git following the directions in the link. Note - this may require you download XCode Tools first, which can be a lengthy (but not complicated) download. | https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#platform-mac
Linux    | If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install git and for Fedora run sudo yum install git. | https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#platform-linux

### Python & Pip
Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python version 2.7.x or greater in Python 2.

## Contact Before, During, After the Workshop

If you have questions or concerns leading up to or after the workshop, you can get in touch in a number of ways:

- Please email Gretchen Gueguen, DPLA Data Services Coordinator and workshop organizer, particularly with logistical or registration questions: [gretchen (at) dp (dot) la](mailto:gretchen@dp.la).
- If you feel comfortable doing so, please open an issue on this GitHub repository, particularly with any questions dealing with workshop preparation or any installation issues. This allows multiple workshop leaders to respond as able, and other participants can also learn (since we're sure the same questions will come up multiple times): https://github.com/dpla/Metadata-Analysis-Workshop/issues (this will require that you login or create a free account with GitHub).
- Alternatively, you can email all the workshop leaders - [Gretchen](mailto:gretchen@dp.la), [Christina Harlow](mailto:cmharlow@gmail.com), and [Audrey Altman](mailto:audrey@dp.la) - with questions if you feel uncomfortable using GitHub issues.
- Some of our workshop leaders are also generally available on a number of Slack channels, including [code4lib](code4lib.slack.com), [Project Hydra](project-hydra.slack.com), [MashCat](mashcat.slack.com), and [Metadata Support Group](metadatasupportgroup.slack.com). If you are already using those spaces, feel free to contact workshop leaders there.

During the workshop, we will indicate the best ways to get help or communicate a question/comment - however, this workshop is intended to be informal, so feel free to speak up or indicate you have a question at any time.
