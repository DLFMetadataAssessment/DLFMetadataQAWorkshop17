# Harvested metadata

A few DPLA partners have offered up their OAI feeds for us to use as sample data for the workshop.

We will walk through how to harvest these datasets yourself in the Harvesting Metadata section, but for now, these data dumps are also available in this harvested-metadata directory (in case the wifi or internet is shaky, or the retrieval is too slow, etc.).
